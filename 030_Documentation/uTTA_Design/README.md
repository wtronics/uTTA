# uTTA - The  (Âµ) micro Thermal Transient Analyzer Design

The current design consists of 3 PCBs which are stacked on top of each other. This stacked design was chosen to thermally decouple the power part from the measurement part.

## The power PCB
This is the PCB at the bottom of the stack. It holds all the parts which are somehow related to power. Therefore, on there is the overall power supply for the whole system. The system is fed by a bipolar power supply which should be able to deliver +/-12V with max. 120mA. In addition, on the power PCB there is the main heating current switch and the heating current measurement which is used to switch and measure the heating current trough the JUT. In addition the power PCB holds a CR2032 backup battery which is used to run the RTC of the microcontroller.

## The Microcontroller PCB
This PCB is an off the shelf STM32F303RE Nucleo-64 Board. During my first tests I found out that the electrolythic capacitors on the power PCB are a little too high (~0.2mm). This causes a big risk of short circuits between the can of the electrolythic caps and some pins of the header rows. Therefore it is highly recommended to trim the pins of header rows CN6, CN8 and CN9 as short as possible to prevent these short. Furthermore it is recommended to remove the push button caps from buttons B1 and B2 as they might be jammed and become staticly pressed by the measure board.

Last but not least the microcontroller PCB is a little modified in terms of jumper settings: 

- Top Side:
  - JP5: E5V
  - JP6: Closed
- Bottom Side:
  - SB45: Open


## The measure PCB
The top most PCB hold everything which is related to measurement. On this PCB there is the Offset voltage reference generator which provides a common offset voltage for all 4 Monitor channels. Then there are 4 so called monitor channels. These channels provide a measurement current of ~1mA to each body diode and sense the voltage drop across the body diode. This voltage drop if amplified and offset with the voltage from the offset generator. Afterwards it is fed into the microcontrollers ADC. In Addition to the monitor channels there are 4 thermocouple transducer ICs MAX6675 to directly convert thermocouple values into temperatures. Finally, there's the FLASH memory on the PCB which is used to save the measurement data during the measurement.
